        <h2>Step 1: Enter a URL</h2>
        <p>
          When you enter a URL in your browser , it sends a request to the
          server where the website is hosted. The URL consists of several
          components, such as the protocol (e.g., "http" or "https"), the domain
          name (e.g., "example.com"), and, optionally, the path to a specific
          page or resource on the website. The browser's first task is to
          determine the IP address of the server hosting the website. This is
          accomplished through a process called DNS resolution.

        <h2>Step 2: DNS Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          The browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name
          into an IP address. DNS (Domain Name System) works like a phonebook
          for the internet, translating human-readable domain names into IP
          addresses that computers understand. DNS resolution typically involves
          several DNS servers, starting with a recursive resolver, which
          contacts other DNS servers, such as root, TLD, and authoritative
          servers, to obtain the IP address associated with the domain name.
          Once the browser receives the IP address, it sends an HTTP or HTTPS
          request to the web server to request the content of the website.

      <div class="info">
        <h2>Step 3: Rendering Web Content</h2>
        <p>
          The browser receives the web content from the server, typically in the
          form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The browser then processes
          these files to render the web page on your screen. First, the browser
          parses the HTML to construct the DOM (Document Object Model) tree,
          which represents the structure of the web page. Next, the browser
          processes the CSS to determine the style and layout of each element on
          the page. Finally, the browser executes any JavaScript code to add
          interactivity and dynamic content to the web page. Web browsers use
          rendering engines (e.g., Blink for Chrome and Edge, WebKit for Safari,
          and Gecko for Firefox) to perform these tasks and display the web page
          on your screen.

        <h2>Step 4: Web Server Response</h2>
        <p>
          Web servers handle incoming requests from browsers and return the
          requested content. When a web server receives a request, it processes
          the request and generates an appropriate response. This response
          typically contains the status code, which indicates the success or
          failure of the request, as well as any requested data, such as HTML,
          CSS, or JavaScript files. Common status codes include 200 OK (request
          succeeded), 404 Not Found (requested resource not found), and 500
          Internal Server Error (server encountered an error processing the
          request).

        <h2>Step 5: Web Security</h2>
        <p>
          Web security is crucial for maintaining the privacy and integrity of
          data transmitted between browsers and servers. HTTPS (Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts
          data using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to
          prevent unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, browsers
          implement security features, such as the Same-Origin Policy and
          Content Security Policy, to protect users from cross-site scripting
          (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other attacks. Users can
          check for a padlock icon in the browser's address bar to verify that a
          website is using HTTPS for secure communication.
