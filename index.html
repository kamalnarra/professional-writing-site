        <h2>Step 1: Enter a URL</h2>
        <p>
          When you type a website address (URL) into your browser, your browser
          sends a request to find the website. The URL has parts like the
          protocol ("http" or "https"), the domain name ("example.com"), and
          sometimes a specific page or resource on the website. The browser's
          first task is to find the website's IP address (a unique number) using
          a process called DNS resolution.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="interactive">
        <input type="text" id="url" placeholder="Enter a URL" />

      <div class="info">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-server"></i> Step 2: DNS Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          To find the website's IP address, the browser asks a DNS (Domain Name
          System) server for help. The DNS server acts like a phonebook for the
          internet, turning domain names we can read into IP addresses that
          computers can understand. This process usually involves several DNS
          servers working together to find the IP address. Once the browser has
          the IP address, it asks the website's server for the content using
          HTTP or HTTPS.

          <i class="fas fa-paint-brush"></i> Step 3: Rendering Web Content
        </h2>
        <p>
          The browser gets the website content from the server, usually as HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript files. It then uses these files to show the
          website on your screen. The browser first reads the HTML to build the
          DOM (Document Object Model) tree, which is like a blueprint for the
          website's structure. Next, the browser applies the CSS to decide how
          each part of the website should look. Finally, the browser runs the
          JavaScript code to make the website interactive and dynamic.

      <div class="info">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-reply"></i> Step 4: Web Server Response</h2>
        <p>
          Web servers handle incoming requests from browsers and give back the
          content they ask for. When a web server gets a request, it processes
          the request and creates an appropriate response. This response usually
          includes a status code, which tells the browser if the request was
          successful or not, as well as the data it asked for (like HTML, CSS,
          or JavaScript files). Common status codes include 200 OK (request was
          successful), 404 Not Found (requested resource not found), and 500
          Internal Server Error (server had an error processing the request).

      <!-- New web security section -->
      <div class="info">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Step 5: Web Security</h2>
        <p>
          Web security is essential for keeping your information private and
          safe while it moves between browsers and servers. HTTPS (Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP that uses
          encryption to protect your data. SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets
          Layer/Transport Layer Security) is the technology that makes this
          encryption possible. Browsers also have security features like the
          Same-Origin Policy and Content Security Policy to protect you from
          harmful online activities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and
          cross-site request forgery (CSRF). To see if a website is secure, look
          for a padlock icon in your browser's address bar.
